      <h3>A True Entrepreneur is not a dreamer he/she is a doer</h3>
          <p>A case could be made i.e. the more people you have in support of your venture, the better its odds of success are. So how do you go about attracting people—venture capitalists, an angel investor, a mentor, coach, partner or manager to help you with key decisions—to your company?
</p>

<p>Much of it comes down to how well you 'click' with people when you first meet. 'Clicking' has always been a subjective art form . . . until brothers Ori and Rom Brafman came along and decoded it in their book Click: The Magic of Instant Connections. At ITIES we aim to connect with Entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>There are 5 key ways of becoming a Talent Magnet and they are as follows:</p>


<ul><li>1. Vulnerability</li>
<li>2. Proximity</li>
<li>3. Resonance</li>
<li>4. Similarities</li>          
<li>5. Shared difficulties</li>
</ul>    <br>      
         
          <p>We know that some of these terms may be unfamiliar to some of you and we don’t even want you to put in extra efforts in order to know the function or meaning of these upper listed terms rather you should focus on your start up! ITIES would do it all for you, you don’t need to worry about anything. At ITIES we have a panel young talented and extraordinary members who would be really happy to teach you the meaning and importance of these terms. You just need to focus on getting your startup ready. These small things would be taken care of by ITIES easily and gracefully.
