        <h3>A better way to get practical: Workshops</h3>
          <p>There is a new trend in colleges: organising workshops. But due to itâ€™s increased frequency they fail to deliver quality in their product and the attendees of the workshops are mislead during these workshops. ITIES aims at destroying the myths that workshops are not inculcating any new thing in the professionals. We at ITIES have a trained team of professionals who aim to deliver workshops in the best possible way ever!</p>
