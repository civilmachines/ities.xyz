      <h3>Why pay just for registration? Pay for what you get when you get!</h3>
          <p>At ITIES we discourage registration costs because we think you should pay for what you get. That’s why we are offering Free Registration and users pay only when they do a paid workshop or course.</p>

<p>And hey, we do take care of our family member. So even if you are a free member of society, there are many perks for you! Foremost being, only a member of ITIES can access our events, workshops and other services.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits of the free membership are as follows</p>


<ul><li>1. E-Alert messages of workshops will be delivered to the user</li>
<li>2. Professionals Advice on Career</li>
<li>3. Updates in particular Stream</li>
<li>4. Regular notifications for workshops and ongoing training sessions would be updated to the user every day</li>          
<li>5. Some  E-Courses would be provided free of cost too for the users of free membership.</li>
<li>6. And again… I tend to forget things easily so there’s a lot more</li>
